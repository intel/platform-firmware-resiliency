## Introduction

Intel(R) Platform Firmware Resilience (Intel(R) PFR) is an Intel FPGA-based solution, (Intel(R) MAX 10(R) FPGA), that helps protect the various platform firmware components. Intel is contributing this capability as an available option on our 3rd-Gen Intel® Xeon® Processor Platforms for those looking for an integrated solution that may not otherwise be available from their platform vendor of choice.

Intel(R) PFR monitors and filters malicious traffic on the system buses. It also verifies the integrity of platform firmware images before any firmware code is executed on the platform.  And most significantly, it can even restore corrupted firmware automatically from a protected known-good recovery image. Data center owners now have additional options to help protect against permanent denial of service firmware attacks with Intel(R) Platform Firmware Resilience.
